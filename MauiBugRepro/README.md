# Bug Report: Platform Analyzer (CA1416) Ignores `OperatingSystem.IsIOSVersionAtLeast`

## Summary

The .NET platform compatibility analyzer (CA1416) incorrectly produces a warning (promoted to an error in this project) for a platform-specific API call, even when the call is properly guarded by an `OperatingSystem.IsIOSVersionAtLeast()` check.

This project demonstrates that the analyzer does not seem to recognize the guard clause, leading to a false positive error that prevents the project from building.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open a terminal in the root directory of the project (`MauiBugRepro`).
3.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    dotnet build -f net9.0-ios -p:RuntimeIdentifier=iossimulator-x64
    ```

## Expected Behavior

The project should build successfully without any warnings or errors. The call to `BGAppRefreshTaskRequest` in `Platforms/iOS/AppDelegate.cs` is inside a `if (OperatingSystem.IsIOSVersionAtLeast(13, 0))` block, which should satisfy the platform compatibility analyzer.

## Actual Behavior

The build fails with the following error, indicating that the analyzer is ignoring the version check:

```
/Users/admin/maui_bug/MauiBugRepro/Platforms/iOS/AppDelegate.cs(18,27): error CA1416: This call site is reachable on 'iOS' 12.2 and later, and 'maccatalyst' 13.0 and later. 'BGAppRefreshTaskRequest' is only supported on: 'ios' 13.0 and later.
```

This is because the `<WarningsAsErrors>CA1416</WarningsAsErrors>` tag in the `.csproj` file promotes the analyzer's warning to a build-breaking error.
